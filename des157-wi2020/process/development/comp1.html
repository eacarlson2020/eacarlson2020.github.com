    <p> Overall, the interaction is that the user will scroll through the page which will create animations and move the story along as they scroll. The text will pop up line by line
        as the user scrolls and animations like the maps moving or shrinking and growing will happen as well. The style is going to involve some playful illustrations of the protagonist and her life, but overall I want the background to be 
        fairly simple so that there is more focus on the animations, information, transitions that will be created in the webpage. Additionally, I want
        the protagonist to be colorful against the bakcground so that she stands out.
