    <h1> Academic Research </h1>
    <p>
        <div class="a">   
<p>Historically, the media has portrayed the LGBTQ community as being filled with affluent, educated, and ultimately assimilated gay and lesbian people, who act as the tastemakers and trendsetters of the uppermiddle class. 
This portrayal of privilege  essentially starts with capitalist America realizing that the LGBTQ community was an untapped consumer market back in the 80s. 
At the time, the only demographic research being done on that community was from a consumer market point of view, rather than a sociological point of view. 
That was problamatic because corporate busineses started touting the statistic that gay men who are married have incomes 20% higher than the average straight man, and other statistics like that to cater to the consumer market. 
They essentially over represented the privilege of the community which has continued to shape how the general public views the LGBTQ population.</p> </div>
<div class="a">  
    <p>However, the truth is actually that LGBTQ populations experience higher rates of poverty, unemployment, wage disparities, incarceration, and homelessness. 
    The most egregious areas are incarceration and homelessness. 20-40% of homeless youth are LGBTQ, they are 3 times more likely to be incarcerated than the national average, and more over 33.3% of the women who are incarcerated are lesbian or bisexual. 
    Additionally, LGBTQ people with children also experience higher rates of poverty. Studies also show that while the American public is more reluctant to claim homophobic sentiment, they feel more open to expressing such feelings under the guise of anonymity. 
    For example, one study sent out resumes that had hints that the individual were apart of queer clubs in college and they found those individuals were less likely to be hired. </p></div>
    <div class="a">  
    <p>On one hand, part of the reason for higher levels of poverty in the community is that in recent years poorer populations feel that they have the ability to actually come out and live their lives as queer. Furthermore, the Queer population is more likely to take up occupations that traditionally have lower incomes. 
    However, on the other hand there is evidence that queer people are less likely to be hired and more likely to be underpaid. 
    Trans people face the most pay discrimination in the community. One theory as to why queer families raising children on average live below the poverty line is because there is such a wage disparity. </p></div>
    <div class="a">  
    <p>Ultimately, it is problematic that most of the issues represented in the community are around assimilation. Assimilation refers to the issues of marriage, military, and adoption, which are rights the community has been fighting for since the begining of the queer rights movemnet. 
    While these issues are important, they overshadow the day to day survival of a large portion of the community, which prevents that portion from getting the help and attention they need and deserve from the government and the public.</p></div>
